# CodeLab: Introduction to Programming

* **Course:** JRL293, WVU
* **Instructors:** Ricky Kirkendall, [rickykirkendall@flocoapps.com](mailto:rickykirkendall@flocoapps.com)
* **Location:** Online
* **Text:** [lynda.com](lynda.com) subscription ($25/Month: Used for duration of class)
* **Coding Exercises:** A full list of coding exercises and their corresponding lessons can be found [here](https://github.com/wvu-ric/cl-mobile-ex-map). The coding exercises are meant to be worked on primarily in-class.

## Course Description
This course will teach students the fundamental concepts of computer programming. Students will be introduced to their first programming language, Javascript, and taught to recognize and create basic programming constructs such as variables, loops, functions and conditionals. Students will also be exposed to the language-agnostic process of algorithmic thinking. The course ends with an introduction to other languages and a summary of their typical uses.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
Upon the successful completion of this Introduction to Programming course:

1. Students will understand the difference between compiled and interpreted languages.
2. Students will understand the use of variables and data types.
3. Students will understand the use of data structures such as arrays and dictionaries.
4. Students will understand programmatic control structures such as conditionals.
5. Students will be able to implement programming constructs in Javascript syntax.
6. Students will learn to write modular code through the use of functions.
7. Students will understand Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
8. Students will learn to think through algorithms using pseudocode.
9. Students will be able to identify the correct language needed to build certain types of applications.

## Suggested Prerequisites
- [Math 126](http://www.math.wvu.edu/~mays/126A/syllabus126a.htm) (General Mathematics)

## Course Format
- **News Posts:** Technology is constantly evolving. Keeping up with the fast-paced industry is key to staying relevant. One good news resource is [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a crowdsourced news site ran by the YCombinator startup incubator. While the post topics range from startups to foreign policy, a majority of them are on computer science and programming. Your job is to keep up with Hacker News and post articles you find interesting on the course message boards. Include a comment about why you're interested in what you posted or your opinion on the subject. **You are required to make 2 posts per week**.

- **Exercises:** Instructional content in this course will be primarily delivered through online video lectures. All content will be hosted on the Blackboard course page. Each exercise corresponds to chapter of the lecture series. Students should watch through each chapter before attempting the exercises. The professor will be available for questions via Blackboard message boards. All videos and exercises will be available for the entire duration of the course. All exercises will be due at the end of the 3-week course, but students are strongly encouraged to keep up with recommended schedule.
