## Course Description
This course will teach students the fundamental concepts of computer programming. Students will be introduced to their first programming language, Javascript, and taught to recognize and create basic programming constructs such as variables, loops, functions and conditionals. Students will also be exposed to the language-agnostic process of algorithmic thinking. The course ends with an introduction to other languages and a summary of their typical uses.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
Upon the successful completion of this Introduction to Programming course:

1. Students will understand the difference between compiled and interpreted languages.
2. Students will understand the use of variables and data types.
3. Students will understand the use of data structures such as arrays and dictionaries.
4. Students will understand programmatic control structures such as conditionals
5. Students will be able to implement programming contructs in Javascript syntax
6. Students will learn to write modular code through the use of functions.
7. Students will understand Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
8. Students will learn to think through algorithms using pseudocode.
9. Students will be able to identify the correct language needed to build certain types of applications.

## Suggested Prerequisites
- [Math 126](http://www.math.wvu.edu/~mays/126A/syllabus126a.htm) (General Mathematics)

## Class Format
- **Availability of a Lab computers:** Software that is needed for this course will be installed and available on the computers at CodeLab computers. Essential software includes: Java SDK, Android Studio IDE, Android SDK on PC machines and Xcode iOS Objective-C softwares on Mac computers. We recommend you to bring your laptops and install this software on your own laptops.
- **Flipped Classroom:** Instructional content in this course will be primarily delivered through online modules. In class time will be used for exercises, discussions and project-based learning.

## Grading System
The final grade will be determined on the basis of the following percentages:

| Final Grade Breakdown                                                         |  %  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Attendance and class participation                                            | 25% |
| Homework and assignments                                                      | 25% |
| Midterm Exam                                                                  | 25% |
| [Final project](https://github.com/wvu-ric/cl-mobile-final) and presentation  | 25% |

### Attendance and Instruction
The instructor reserves the right to postpone or rearrange the presentation of material by making an announcement during a regularly scheduled class meeting.  Examinations will not be moved without announcing the change at least one (1) week prior to the scheduled time. No makeup exams offered unless prior notice was given or medical excuses. The syllabus is a general guideline and does not constitute a contract between the student, instructors and the University. Our attendance policy allows only up to 4 classes to be missed without formal excuse, after four (4) absents, class grade will be affected. 

### Social Justice and Americans with Disabilities Act
West Virginia University is committed to social justice.  We concur with that commitment and expect to foster a nurturing learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination.  Our University does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin.  Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in this class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.
WVU recognizes the diversity of its students and the needs of those who wish to be absent from class to participate in Days of Special Concern, which are listed in the Schedule of Courses.  Students should notify their instructors by the end of the second week of classes or prior to the first Day of Special Concern, whichever is earlier, regarding Day of Special Concern observances that will affect their attendance.  The instructor will make reasonable accommodation for tests or field trips that a student misses as a result of observing a Day of Special Concern.
If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise us and make appropriate arrangements with Disability Services (293-6700).
